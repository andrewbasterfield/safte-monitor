    <h2>safte-monitor - Linux SAF-TE SCSI enclosure monitor</h2>
    <p>Latest release: <a href="safte-monitor-1.0.0rc1.tar.gz">safte-monitor-1.0.0rc1.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>
safte-monitor reads disk enclosure status information from SAF-TE capable
enclosures (SCSI Accessible Fault Tolerant Enclosures). SAF-TE is common
on many intelligent SCSI disk enclosures and some rackmount servers with
SCSI hotswap drive bays. safte-monitor can monitor multiple SAF-TE
devices and will automatically probe and detect them.
</p><p>
The information retreived includes power supply, fan, temperature, audible
alarm, drive faults, array critical / failed / rebuilding state and door
lock status. safte-monitor logs changes in the status of these enclosure
elements to syslog and can optionally execute an alert help program with
details of the component failure. This could send a pager message
for example. Temperature alert limits can also be set.
</p><p>
safte-monitor is specifcally useful if you have equipment deployed in
remote locations or unattended over weekends when no-one may hear an
audible alarm.
</p>
<pre>usage:	./safte-monitor [-h] [-p] [-n] [-a] [-T] [-t &lt;max_temp>] [-A &lt;alert_prog>]

-h     show this help message
-p     print - print device scan information then exit
-T     log temperature changes
-N     alert for non critical state changes
-A &lt;f> program to run for alerts
-t &lt;n> max temperature (default 35.0 celcius)
-n     numeric sg device names eg. /dev/sg0 (default)
-a     alpha sg device names eg. /dev/sga</pre>
    <p>By default temperatures and temperature limits are in Celcius. This
    can be changed to Farenheit by removing the -DUSE_CELCIUS from the
    Makefile.</p>
    <h3>Example alert helper program:</h3>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
echo ALERT device=$1 message=$2 system=$3 partno=$4 code=$5 | \
	mail -s 'safte alert' root</pre>
    <h3>Example output from a scan</h3>

    <h3>Bugs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes doesn't probe devices on first startup if sg module isn't loaded</li>

    <h3>To do</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Make celcius/farenheit a command line option.</li>
    <li>Set temp limits seperately for different enclosures or individual
    sensors.</li>
    <li>implement SNMP traps for alerts - this could be done with an external
    alert helper program.</li>
    <li>Add a remote interface for checking status (SNMP)</li>
    <li>Add mon compatible service test agent</li>
    <li>Finish off autoconfigure support</li>
    <li>Make safte-monitor dynamically rescan for safte devices after startup to
  eliminate the need for a restart to the daemon</li>
    <li>Integrate with software RAID</li>
    </ul>
