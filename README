safte-monitor - Linux SAF-TE SCSI enclosure monitor

safte-monitor reads disk enclosure status information from SAF-TE capable
enclosures (SCSI Accessible Fault Tolerant Enclosures). SAF-TE is common
on many intelligent SCSI disk enclosures and some rackmount servers with
SCSI hotswap drive bays. safte-monitor can monitor multiple SAF-TE
devices and will automatically probe and detect them.

The information retreived includes power supply, fan, temperature, audible
alarm, drive faults, array critical / failed / rebuilding state and door
lock status. safte-monitor logs changes in the status of these enclosure
elements to syslog and can optionally execute an alert help program with
details of the component failure. This could send a pager message
for example. Temperature alert limits can also be set.

safte-monitor is specifcally useful if you have equipment deployed in
remote locations or unattended over weekends when no-one may hear an
audible alarm.

By default safte-monitor will run in the background and log to syslog.
It can be run in one-shot scan mode to print found SAF-TE device info
using the -p flag. It will also respond to web requests on port 8123
and display HTML output of enclosure status.

usage:	./safte-monitor [-h] [-p] [-n] [-a] [-T] [-t <max_temp>] \
                  [-A <alert_prog>]

-h     show this help message
-p     print - print device scan information then exit
-T     log temperature changes
-N     alert for non critical state changes
-A <f> program to run for alerts
-t <n> max temperature (default 35.0 celcius)
-n     numeric sg device names eg. /dev/sg0 (default)
-a     alpha sg device names eg. /dev/sga


By default temperatures and temperature limits are in Celcius. This can be
changed to Farenheit by removing the -DUSE_CELCIUS from the Makefile.


Example alert helper program:
-----------------------------

#!/bin/sh
echo ALERT device=$1 message=$2 system=$3 partno=$4 code=$5 | \
	mail -s 'safte alert' root


Example output from a scan:
---------------------------

Example syslog messages:
------------------------

a temperature change (if option is selected to log temp changes)

SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:52): temp sensor 2 changed from '23.9 degrees' to '22.8 degrees'

a power supply failing

SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): power supply 1 changed from 'okay and on' to 'malfunctioning and commanded on'
SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): ALERT power supply 1 malfunctioning and commanded on

the power supply back up again

SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): power supply 1 changed from 'malfunctioning and commanded on' to 'okay and on'

a drive in an array fails

SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): device slot 4 changed from 'disk present,no error' to 'disk present,critical array'
SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): ALERT device slot 4 is disk present,critical array
SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): device slot 5 changed from 'disk present,no error' to 'disk present,faulty'
SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): ALERT device slot 5 is disk present,faulty

after a rebuild has been started

SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): device slot 4 changed from 'disk present,critical array' to 'disk present,rebuilding,critical array'
SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): ALERT device slot 4 is disk present,rebuilding,critical array
SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): device slot 5 changed from 'disk present,faulty' to 'disk present,rebuilding,critical array'
SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): ALERT device slot 5 is disk present,rebuilding,critical array

and now the array is okay again

SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): device slot 4 changed from 'disk present,rebuilding,critical array' to 'disk present,no error'
SAF-TE Device CNSi G8324 (2:0:0:51): device slot 5 changed from 'disk present,rebuilding,critical array' to 'disk present,no error'


Bugs
----
* Sometimes doesn't probe devices on first startup if sg module isn't loaded

To do
-----
* Make celcius/farenheit a command line option.
* Set temp limits seperately for different enclosures or individual sensors.
* implement SNMP traps for alerts - this could be done with an external alert
  helper program.
* Add a remote interface for checking status (SNMP)
* Add mon compatible service test agent
* Finish off autoconfigure support
* Make safte-monitor dynamically rescan for safte devices after startup to
  eliminate the need for a restart to the daemon
* Integrate with software RAID
